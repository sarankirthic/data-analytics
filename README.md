# End-to-End Data Pipeline Using AWS S3 Bucket for News
This project is an end-to-end news data pipeline that automatically fetches news articles, processes and cleans the 
data, and stores the results in an AWS S3 bucket for scalable and durable storage.

## Features
### Data Extraction from Multiple Sources
1. `APIs:` Consuming structured JSON data from services like News API, social media feeds and RSS feeds. 
2. `Web Scraping:` Extracting information from web pages that donâ€™t have APIs, using tools like BeautifulSoup. 
3. `Databases:` Pulling data from internal or external databases. 
4. `Message Queues or Stream Sources:` Like Kafka or AWS Kinesis for real-time event-driven data.

### ETL Processing(Extract, Transform, Load)
1. `Extract:` Fetching raw data from the source systems. 
2. `Transform:` Cleaning, filtering, enriching, or restructuring data into a useful format. Examples:
    - Parsing JSON or XML to flat tables. 
    - Handling missing or duplicate values. 
    - Calculating additional metrics like sentiment or categories. 
3. `Load:` Storing the processed data into a data warehouse, data lake, or database for further analysis.

### Real-Time and Batch Data Workflows
1. `Batch Processing:` Data is collected over a period, processed as a single batch at a scheduled time (e.g., hourly, daily). 
Useful for large data volumes and less time-sensitive reports. 
2. `Real-Time Processing:` Data is processed immediately as it arrives (streaming). Enables instant insights and actions 
such as alerting or live dashboards.

## Upcoming Features
### Predictive Analysis 
This uses historical data to forecast future trends and behaviors with:

1. `Machine Learning Models:` Regression, classification, or time-series forecasting models. 
2. `Statistical Analysis:` Identifying patterns, seasonality, or anomaly detection. 
3. `Use Cases:` Predicting user engagement, news trends, market changes, or operational risks.

### Interactive Dashboards

1. `Data Visualization Tools:` Tableau, Power BI, Grafana, or custom web apps with charting libraries. 
2. `Interactivity:` Filters, drill-downs, real-time updates, and dynamic querying. 
3. `Purpose:` Empower stakeholders to explore key metrics, monitor KPIs, and discover actionable insights quickly.
